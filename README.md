## How to run
Start by registering a new user. If you are an existing user, your credentials are authenticated before being redirected to the My Profile Page. On this page you'll see account details, your recipes, the option to add a recipe, and a tab for managing your family. When adding a new recipe, you can add all the relevant details and upload an image straight from your library. If you click on one of your recipes, you will be redirected to the Recipes page. On this page you can update or delete an existing recipe.
